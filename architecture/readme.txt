GENERAL OUTLINE:

-- REGISTERS
	-- 4 general purpose registers (A, B, C, D).			[8 bit]
	-- PROGRAM Register (inside of program counter)			[8 bit]
	-- INSTRUCTION Register						[16 bit]
		-- Splits into three pieces for most instructions
		-- INSTRUCTION						[8 bit]
		-- rA, rB						[8 bit, 8 bit]
		-- IMMEDIATE						[8 bit]
	-- TWO math registers (mA, mB)					[8 bit]
	-- 
-- ALU
	-- mA & mB Registers constantly output to ALU.
	-- All ALU components constantly compute on mA & mB.
		-- Perhaps this needs to be revised (division by zero?)
	-- Implementing subtraction and addition into same circuit
		-- Convert mB to -mB if subtracting, then add mA+mB.
	-- ALU operations:
		-- ADD, SUB, MULT, AND, OR, XOR, NOR
-- BUSSES
	-- DATA BUS							[8 bit]
	-- INSTRUCTION BUS						[16 bit]
		-- First 8 bits are the instruction
		-- Next 8 bits are either an immediate, or one/two regs
	-- ADDRESS BUS							[16 bit]
	-- COUNT BUS							[8 bit]
